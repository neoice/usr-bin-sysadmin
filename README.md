I once made a joke about how I was spending my afternoon as "#!/usr/bin/sysadmin", ie: a human shell script.

This got me thinking... at my job, we maintain a number of small scripts that are part documentation, part human shell script.
Why not write an actual shell to faciliate the "running" of these documents?

This is effectively just a proof-of-concept. I have not determined the best way to structure the documentation.
I also want to implement some sort of logging/changelog mechanism.
