#!/usr/bin/sysadmin

### comments ###
# anything that is a comment is parsed as "text"
# and printed on stdout.
#
# non-comment lines are "code examples".

/bin/echo "commands are tasks that the sysadmin will run."

### commands ###
# the interpretter will pause and prompt (y/n) for the completion
# of the action. some commands will use the sysadmin as the
# interpretter. for example:

ssh -i /var/backups/.ssh/id_rsa backupuser@$HOST

# tasks do not need to be labelled either
/bin/echo "this may be changed later as the shell evolves"
